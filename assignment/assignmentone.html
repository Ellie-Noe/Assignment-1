                <p>[Verse 1]
                    In this cold place, where the snow hasn't melted yet
                    Leaves that resemble the cold are growing, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
                    My freezing breath, frozen memories, oh-oh
                    Oh, where my house has gone, I lost my bearings
                    
                    [Pre-Chorus]
                    Oh-oh-oh-ah
                    Oh-oh
                    I'm lost in my dreams
                    Oh-I, oh-I, oh-I
                    (Ah-ah)
                    (I'm lost in my dreams)
                    
                    [Chorus]
                    Erase me from here and set me free
                    All I wanted was to fly high (Ooh, oh, ah-ah)
                    I can't believe my wings are broken
                    And fell against the sky
                    Oh-oh-oh-ah
                    
                    [Verse 2]
                    Will you please take me home?
                    A flightless feather, oh-oh-oh
                    My freezing breath, frozen memories
                    Fearless behavior
                    It doesn't exist in me anymore

                    Erase me from here and set me free
                    All I wanted was to fly high (Ooh, oh, ah-ah)
                    I can't believe my wings are broken
                    And fell against the sky
